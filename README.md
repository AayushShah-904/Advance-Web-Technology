It looks like you're working on a collection of Node.js and React labs! Based on your file structure, you have three distinct projects: an **Event Emitter** demo, a **React App** (Vite), and a **Task Manager** API/App.

Here is a comprehensive `README.md` that organizes these projects professionally.

# LAB: Node.js & React Collection

This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises covering core Node.js concepts, React frontend development, and full-stack application building.

## 📁 Project Structure

* **`Event_Emitter/`**: Introduction to the Node.js `events` module.
* `event_emitter_basic.js`: Demonstrates custom event handling and listeners.


* **`my-react-app/`**: A modern React frontend built using **Vite**.
* Features a standard React/SRC structure with ESLint and Vite configurations.


* **`Task_Manager/`**: A full-stack or backend-focused application for managing tasks.
* `app.js`: Main entry point for the task management logic.
* Contains its own dependencies and public assets.


* **Root Level**:
* `server.js`: Likely a main entry point or proxy server for the lab environment.
* `Lab1.pptx`: Documentation or presentation slides related to the lab.
